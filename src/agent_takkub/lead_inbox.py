"""Lead-inbox queue cluster — ready-prompt-aware serialised delivery to Lead.

Extracted from orchestrator.py (lead_notify_pump cluster, refactor round 5).
Provides ``LeadInboxMixin`` which ``Orchestrator`` inherits so all queue
ownership stays in one module.

Also houses the pane submit helpers (_delayed_enter / _delayed_enter_verified)
that the cluster methods depend on and that were previously module-level in
orchestrator.py.

Also houses the Lead draft-typing guard (issue #3, 2026-07-09 core-upgrade
plan): `_track_lead_draft_input` / `_lead_can_accept_injection` /
`_lead_draft_hold_expired`, backed by the pure state machine in
`lead_draft_state.py`. `Orchestrator._on_pane_input` feeds every Lead-pane
keystroke into the tracker; `_pump_lead_notify` and `_flush_pending_lead_cc`
gate through the same `_lead_can_accept_injection()` so a done-notice/CC
paste never lands on top of the user's unsubmitted draft.

Layer rule (enforced by import-linter "lead-inbox-layer" contract):
  lead_inbox MUST NOT import orchestrator / main_window / app / cli.

State ownership rule: _lead_notify_queue, _lead_digest_queue, _digest_timer,
_pending_lead_cc, _pending_done_notices, _lead_notify_pumping,
_lead_notify_retry, _lead_draft_state MUST stay in Orchestrator.__init__.  This mixin only
defines methods — never the initial dict assignments — so queue ownership
stays centralised and divergence bugs cannot creep back in.

# one — repasting up to _SUBMIT_MAX_RESENDS times (the visible "4× [Pasted
# text]" stack). A pane still rendering is producing output, so before repasting
# we re-poll while output stayed recent within _RENDER_ACTIVE_S, bounded by

# wall-clock time — so a paste that was simply still painting under CPU

    Sends the submitting CR after ``delay_ms`` (same as `_delayed_enter`), then

    is STILL at its ready prompt the submit did not land (a real submit would
    have flipped it to busy), so it recovers — bounded by ``max_resends``.

    Two failure modes are distinguished when ``payload`` is supplied (#79):
      • Enter swallowed mid-paste-render — the input box still holds the pasted
        content (``shows_pending_input`` True). Re-send the CR only. (#22)
      • Paste swallowed — the input box is empty (``shows_pending_input`` False),
        so a CR resend has nothing to submit and the pane sits idle forever
        ("pane stays empty" — the #26 symptom). Re-paste the payload, then submit
        after the render settles.
    When ``payload`` is None the old behaviour (CR resend only) is preserved.

    A not-ready verdict is cross-checked against the input box too (#99):
    a busy marker unrelated to this submit (e.g. codex booting its own MCP
    servers) can read as not-ready while the paste is still visibly stuck in
    the composer. When that happens the CR is resent instead of the verify
    chain concluding "submitted" and stopping for good.

    Before EVERY verify decision, a live Qt main-thread heartbeat probe is
    checked (#133): a fan-out of concurrent pane spawns can backlog the event
    loop for ~1s at a time, and every verify() timer queued during that
    backlog then fires in a burst the instant it clears — collapsing the
    intended real-time render-settle grace into milliseconds and making a
    paste that was simply still painting under CPU contention look swallowed.
    If the probe reports the heartbeat went stale recently, the decision is
    DEFERRED (one more grace wait, budget unconsumed) instead of concluded —
    bounded so a stuck probe can't wedge the chain forever.

    ``on_resend`` / ``on_repaste`` (optional) are invoked with the
    remaining-attempt count each time the respective recovery fires, so the
    caller can log/observe it. ``on_settled`` (optional) fires exactly once,
    with no args, when the chain stops trying — submitted, gave up, or the
