        Root cause this fixes: `session_uuid` used to be stamped ONLY at spawn

        about, so the remote/mobile mirror's exact-uuid lookup misses and shows
        a blank chat (see `remote/notify.py`). `SessionStart` fires on every

        session_id — reporting it here keeps `pane_state.session_uuid` correct
