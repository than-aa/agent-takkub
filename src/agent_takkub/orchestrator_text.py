# Per-role model tier: (model, effort, fallback-model). Picked per role
# rather than one flat tier for all teammates because the cockpit owner runs
# on Claude Max (per-token cost irrelevant), so the only real tradeoff is
# latency. That lets us spend quality where a miss is expensive and stay snappy
# where it isn't:
#
#   • Gate roles (reviewer, critic) — the last line before something ships.
#     A missed bug / UX flaw leaks to production, and these run infrequently
#     at verify/pre-ship hops where the user is already waiting, so latency
#     barely matters. → Opus, high effort. Fallback Sonnet (not Haiku) so a
#     degraded gate is still strong.
#   • Correctness-sensitive impl (backend, devops) — API contracts, schema,
#     migrations, and irreversible deploy/infra. High frequency, so stay on
#     Sonnet for turn speed but raise effort to cut subtle-bug rework cycles.
#   • Everything else (frontend, mobile, qa, designer) — execution-heavy,
#     high frequency, low blast radius → Sonnet medium (the default tier) for
#     snappy turns.
#
# The global TAKKUB_TEAMMATE_MODEL / _EFFORT / _FALLBACK env vars still win
# when explicitly set — they override every role's per-role default at once.
#
# Model-id hygiene: this table hardcodes concrete Claude model ids as the
# *default* tier per role — separate from settings_window.py's
# _MODELS_BY_PROVIDER (a dropdown PRESET list that intentionally keeps older
# ids selectable) and plan_tier.py (usage-credit gating, keyed by whatever
# model a pane actually ends up running). When Anthropic ships a new
# generation, update the id HERE (the actual default everyone spawns with);
# _MODELS_BY_PROVIDER only needs the new id added as one more offered preset,
# it doesn't need the old ones removed. The two lists drifted once already
