"""Per-role CLI provider mapping.

The cockpit can spawn teammate panes backed by any CLI registered in
``provider_spec.PROVIDER_REGISTRY``. By default every role except the forced
provider-identity roles runs claude. This module lets the user override the mapping globally —
e.g. "backend always uses codex regardless of project" — by editing
a small JSON file under `~/.takkub/`.

Resolution rules:
- `lead`   → user config wins; default `claude` (issue #101, degraded-mode
             unlock: a codex/agy-backed Lead is now allowed. Default stays
             claude — unlock is opt-in, not a default change. Switching Lead
             off claude loses several claude-specific capabilities (mobile
             mirror, `--resume`, remote-control history/resume, JSONL token
             meter) — see docs/reviews/2026-07-11-101-lead-unlock.md and the
             `supports_*` capability flags on `provider_spec.ProviderSpec`
             that gate each of those call sites instead of crashing.)
- `codex`  → always `codex` (the role's whole point)
- `gemini` → always `gemini` (the role's whole point)
- `opencode` → always `opencode` (the role's whole point)
- `kimi`   → always `kimi` (the role's whole point)
- `cursor` → always `cursor` (the role's whole point)
- everything else → user config wins; default `claude`

Config file: `~/.takkub/role-providers.json`. Created on first read
if missing (empty `{}`). Hand-edit to override:

    {"backend": "codex", "qa": "gemini"}

`provider_for("backend")` then returns `"codex"`. Restart cockpit
to pick up changes (no live reload in v1).
