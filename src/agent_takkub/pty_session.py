    ubiquitous in the claude/agy/codex spinner + status lines that repaint a

      • on a Lead pane — made ``is_at_ready_prompt`` raise inside the notify pump /
        reaper, so queued done notices never reached the Lead.
    Both surface as "pane finished, closed, never reported back" — and get worse
    with many panes/projects open (more terminals → higher odds one holds a poison

# When a model outputs tool-call XML without the required `antml:` namespace
# prefix (using bare `<invoke>` / `<parameter>` / `<function_calls>` instead
# of `<invoke>` etc.) the harness cannot parse and execute it — the XML
# simply renders as plain text and the pane appears to hang silently.
#
# Key invariant: a *well-formed* tool call is consumed by the harness before
# reaching the terminal renderer, so it never appears as literal text on-screen.
# Any occurrence of these tag patterns as visible text therefore means the tool
# call is malformed and was never executed.
#
# Patterns cover both opening and closing tags, with or without the `antml:`
# prefix, since either variant appearing as screen text signals a parse failure.

# ── Ready-prompt detection markers (M4#17) ──────────────────────────────────
# is_at_ready_prompt() decides whether a pane is idle at its input prompt. The
# markers are provider-specific bottom-row UI strings; when an upstream CLI
# rewords its prompt, detection silently breaks and that provider's idle
# watchdog / done-gate stalls — this happened 3x (gemini input hint, gemini
# update footer #51, codex splash). Centralised here as ONE ordered table so a
# reword is a one-line patch, with an env override to rescue a reworded prompt
# without shipping code, and a doctor self-test that flags a stale marker.
#
# Version-dependence registry (#20) — every marker below is natural-language UI
# text owned by an upstream CLI, so ALL are version-dependent. By blast radius:
#   HIGH  'esc to interrupt' / 'esc to cancel' — the busy indicators. A reword
#         makes a working pane read idle (premature done-nudge / early gate).
#   HIGH  'bypass permissions' / 'shift+tab to cycle' (claude), '? for shortcuts'
#         (agy), 'type your message or' (gemini), 'fast off' / 'fast on' (codex
#         composer status bar) — the idle footers. A reword makes an idle pane
#         read busy (watchdog never nudges; #70-style stall).
#   MED   'update available!' (codex splash), 'trust this folder' / 'do you trust'
#         / 'press enter to continue' (trust modals) — transient spawn-time gates.
#   LOW   'gemini cli update available!' — passive banner. ('openai codex (v'
#         is intentionally NOT a ready marker — see #99 note by _READY_RULES.)
# Replacing this text with structural signals (exit codes / pty mode / ANSI) is
# largely infeasible: the CLI is one long-lived interactive TUI (no exit code
# while running) always in raw mode (no discriminating pty flag). The mitigation
# is layered instead of a rewrite:
#   1. _ready_region() scopes matching to the bottom footer rows so conversation
#      body text quoting a marker can't poison the verdict (#70 root fix).
#   2. TAKKUB_EXTRA_READY_MARKERS lets an operator rescue a reword with no deploy.
#   3. ready_marker_selftest() (takkub doctor) catches a stale shipped marker.
#   4. The orchestrator's structural stale-marker detector (output-quiescence +
#      no-marker-match → 'ready_marker_possibly_stale' log with the real footer)
#      turns a field reword from a SILENT idle-watchdog stall into a loud,
#      actionable diagnostic. See Orchestrator._check_stale_markers.
#
# Hard blockers: any present → NEVER ready (active interrupt / modal), even if a
# ready marker is also on screen.
#
# _READY_HARD_BLOCKERS / _READY_RULES now come from provider_spec.py's
# PROVIDER_REGISTRY (issue #103 Phase 0) — imported above as
# READY_HARD_BLOCKERS / READY_RULES and aliased back to these names for every
# existing call site (is_at_ready_prompt, ready_marker_selftest, etc.) to keep
# working unchanged. provider_spec.py builds them by ORDERED CONCAT across the
# three shipped specs (gemini, then codex, then claude) — reproducing this
# exact table byte-for-byte — instead of a hand-written flat tuple, so a new
# provider only needs a new ProviderSpec entry, not an edit here.
#
# The concat order still matters and is still enforced there: gemini's
# persistent input hint + passive update footer must beat codex's bare
# "update available!" splash blocker (substring collision — gemini's "gemini
# cli update available!" contains codex's "update available!"). Codex's
# startup banner ("OpenAI Codex (vX.Y.Z)") is deliberately NOT a ready marker
# (#99) — it paints before codex finishes auto-booting its MCP servers, so
# treating the banner alone as ready raced task delivery into a still-busy
# composer. Codex readiness depends solely on its composer status bar ("Fast
# off"/"Fast on"), verified by direct pty capture to only render once codex
# has actually reached its interactive prompt. See provider_spec.py's
# codex_spec.ready_rules comment for the full detail.
